Carpaccio di Ricciola represents itself like in the picture. It's interesting because it's on a heated plate. It's a raw fish on a heated plate and so it gets a bit lukewarm. But it's interesting. I think I would have preferred the Carpaccio cold instead of lukewarm. But the fruits of the capers are really good. And also there is a very good mozzarella in the middle. The first one has arrived. It looks like a real peasant thing. With guanciale, thick pasta and cheese. Let's see how it is. Obviously there is also sausage. There is clearly also sausage in this. It's really a classic. It's heavy inside. Sausage, guanciale, there is also egg and thick pasta. I don't know if I can finish this. The first one was a dish for zappatori. It was very heavy. But it was done well. Nothing extraordinary. I could do it too. The thick pasta went well with the sauce. The second one doesn't look exciting but it tastes exciting. I think the wine had a real problem. It was a bit of cork and I sent it back.
